Kinesis, Firehose, Analytics
- Streaming analysd on fly
- Streams/ Shards
	Shard is uniquely identified sequence of data records in a stream. Read: support 5 transactions/sec for read and upto total data of 2Mb/sec. Write 1Kb/sec
	A stream is composedof one m+or more shards, each of which provides a fixed unit of capacity.
- Data Records - 3 things : sequence nu, parition key and data (i.e blob).
- Partition key is used to group data by shards within a stream.

SQS vs kinesis
- Producer/Consumer vs V Dta
- VT Delay vs Shard
- Kinesis - Super fast 
- Indivual Message vs Aggregate Message
- 1 consumer vs Multiple Consumer processing at parallel.
- Retry: Visibility Timeout vs Failed Message can block processing.
