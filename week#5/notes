SQS - Simple Queue Service
	- Pull based Queue compared to SNS
	- Do you have anything for me.
	- Producer/Consumer of message
	- SQS has to hold the data i.e guidelines how long to hold data the data, how to seamlessly deliver message to all consumers.
	- Message have finite lifetimes.
	- 2 Queues: FIFO & standard Queue
		- Order of message vs Velocity of message is imp.
		FiFo: First-in-first-out delivery, Exactly-once processing. Order is guarantee.
		Standard: Best-effort ordering, At-least once delivery, occasionaly more than 1 copy of message is delivered.
	- Limited data storage.
	- Dead letter queue
	In case consumers are unable to consume the message, the messages are transferred from Q from Redrive or dead queue.
